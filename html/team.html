He received his PhD in Visual Cognitive Neuroscience from La Trobe University, Australia, where he examined the neural and cognitive mechanisms of ‘form’ processing and its contribution to visual perception. Most notably, he did extensive work on the rare syndrome visual form agnosia. He seeks to further investigate these mechanisms and how they relate to perceptual distortions in other disorders of perception. In his spare time, he likes to climb boulders, explore, and play chess.</p>

She received her Bachelor of Science Degree from University of Toronto, specializing in Psychological and Health Sciences. Broadly, she is interested in research that aims to advance our understanding of mental health disorders in order to improve clinical outcomes. This has led her to support a variety of research projects, including assessing the efficacy of brain stimulation treatments for individuals with Alzheimer’s and depression, as well as exploring emotional/psychological symptom assessment and management in solid organ transplant recipients. Currently, she is excited to explore how abnormal perceptual processing may play a role in Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD), in order to lay the groundwork for future clinical studies to test perceptual training as a potential treatment for BDD. In her spare time, Katalin enjoys reading fantasy novels, hiking, dancing, and playing the guitar.</p>

                            <p class="about">Akansha Naraindas completed her BSc in Psychology at Durham University in 2019, followed by an MSc in Mental Health from Kings College London in 2020. Her research interests surround body representation and cognitive neuroscience, particularly within psychiatric populations. Her current research looks at body based mental imagery and its relationship to body image disturbance and interoceptive awareness from early to late adulthood. She is especially fascinated by the use of Virtual Reality (VR) in spatial cognition research and its remarkable potential to investigate unique sensory bodily experiences within experimental contexts. She also has a strong interest in the translational potential of VR within clinical health especially surrounding psychiatric care.</p>

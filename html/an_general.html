            <div class="section-content">

                <p>Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a psychiatric condition that is characterized by abnormally low weight and refusal to maintain a minimally normal weight. It is accompanied by intense fear of weight gain or being "fat," even when underweight, and denial of the seriousness of the effects of extreme weight loss. It is also associated with a distorted perception of the body, and one’s self-worth being overly influenced by body weight or shape.</p>

                <p> <strong> Here are questions that might help you decide if you are experiencing symptoms of anorexia nervosa: </strong> </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Do you have a fear of gaining weight or becoming fat, even though others tell you that you are underweight?</li>
                    <li>Has your body weight been significantly less than normal for your height?</li>
                    <li>Do you see your body in a different way than others see it, or place a lot of value on your body weight and shape, or think that your low body weight is not a problem, even though others do?</li>
                    <li>Have you had at least three months in a row when you did not have a period (menstruation), or do you only have a period when you are on birth control pills?</li>
                    <li>To prevent weight gain do you restrict what you eat, or make yourself vomit, or exercise excessively, or use laxatives, diuretics, or diet pills?</li>
                </ul>

                <p>If you answered yes to several of these questions, you might have anorexia nervosa and should seek a full diagnostic evaluation.</p>

        Treatment

        <section id="treatment">

            <h1>Treatment</h1>

            <div class="section-content">

                <p>Fortunately, treatment is available and can often result in significant improvements in AN symptoms.</p>
                
                <p>Studies have shown that for some, treatment with medications and/or cognitive-behavioral therapy can result in significant improvement in symptoms and functioning.</p>
            
                <p>The following information is provided as a guideline and should not be used in substitution for a consultation with a mental health specialist. People with AN may have a variety of additional problems and may experience varying responses to treatments, so a comprehensive assessment by a psychiatrist and an individualized treatment plan (ideally in conjunction with a psychotherapist) are highly recommended.</p>

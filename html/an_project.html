                <p>Anorexia nervosa (AN) is an eating disorder that is characterized by severe weight loss and difficulties maintaining an appropriate body weight for one’s height and age. For many individuals, it is associated with a distorted body image. Individuals with AN usually restrict the number of calories or the types of foods they eat, and some also exercise excessively to restrict weight gain. AN is also characterized by a reduced desire to pursue rewarding experiences and, if received, not as strong of a feeling of reward.</p>

                <p>The purpose of this study is to identify whether individuals with AN can learn positive (reward-based) associations, how these associations diminish, and their relationships to heart rate, pupil responses, and brain activation. The study will also investigate the extent to which this positive association is reactivated after 24 hours, and the extent to which a memory prompt will help reinstate this previously learned association. The results from this study will provide a better understanding of the processes of reward learning in individuals with AN. This will inform development of novel treatments that could increase incentives for pursing rewarding social- and food consumption related- experiences, and counteract fear of weight gain, which are fundamental to recovery.</p>

                <p>Participation in this study involves 3 study visits and one follow-up questionnaire after 6 months (no more than 5 hours in total). The informed consent discussion and visit 1 will be done online via secure videoconferencing, while visits 2 and 3 will require in-person visits at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH). Participation in the study involves the completion of clinical assessments and symptom rating scales and undergoing a brain MRI scan.</p>

                <p>You will be compensated for your time should you wish to participate and complete all study visits.</p>

            <h1>About</h1>

            <div class="section-content">

                <p>I graduated with honors from the University of California San Diego with a major in Biochemistry and Cell Biology. I obtained my medical degree and completed my psychiatry residency training at UCLA. I then completed a clinical psychopharmacology fellowship followed by a National Institute of Mental Health T32 psychobiology research fellowship where I received training in neuroimaging.</p>

                <p>I came to the University of Toronto in July 2021. I was previously a Professor of Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Sciences at UCLA, where I was on faculty from 2006-2021 and was the Director of the UCLA Eating Disorders and Body Dysmorphic Disorder Research Program and the Director of the UCLA Adult OCD Program. My clinical areas of specialty are eating disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), and anxiety disorders. I have taught cognitive-behavioral therapy and pharmacotherapy to psychiatry residents and other mental health providers, and provide research supervision and mentorship to junior faculty, postdoctoral fellows, neuroscience Ph.D. students, psychology Ph.D. students, master's students, undergraduates, and high school students.</p>

            <div class="section-content">

                <p>My clinical neuroscience research seeks to understand the brain basis of perception, emotion, and reward across conditions involving body image and obsessions and compulsions. I also studies gender identity, own body perception, and the effects of hormone treatments in individuals with gender dysphoria in the interest of improving health outcomes of gender-affirming treatments. I lecture internationally on these topics. I am a member of the Eating Disorder Research Society and the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology, and an elected Board Member of the International College of Obsessive Compulsive Spectrum Disorders.</p>

                <p>My research utilizes functional and structural neuroimaging (fMRI, DTI, brain morphology, and EEG), psychophysical testing, and neuromodulation to understand the brain and behavior. I have also created novel digital applications to assess and quantify body and appearance perception. My seminal research includes the first functional neuroimaging studies in BDD, the first studies to directly compare the neurobiology of BDD to anorexia nervosa, and pre-translational research investigating visual perceptual modulation in behavioral and TMS approaches to improve body image distortions. My pioneering functional brain imaging studies in BDD discovered that distorted perception of appearance is related to abnormal visual processing. His later research uncovered similar abnormalities in visual processing in anorexia nervosa. My research influenced the change in classification of BDD to an obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Psychiatric Disorders (DSM-5). I have been funded continuously for my research from government and foundation grants for the past 14 years.</p>

                <p>My research has been featured in the media including the BBC, CNN, NBC, The New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, Forbes, Nature, and Scientific American Mind.</p>

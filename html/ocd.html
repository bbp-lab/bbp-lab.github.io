            <div class="section-content">

                <p>Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is a mental and behavioral disorder in which an individual has intrusive thoughts and/or feels the need to perform certain routines repeatedly to the extent where it induces distress or impairs general function. As indicated by the disorder's name, the primary symptoms of OCD are obsessions and compulsions. Obsessions are persistent unwanted thoughts, mental images, or urges that generate feelings of anxiety, disgust, or discomfort. Common obsessions include fear of contamination, obsession with symmetry, and intrusive thoughts about religion, sex, and harm. Compulsions are repeated actions or routines that occur in response to obsessions. Common compulsions include excessive hand washing, cleaning, arranging things, counting, seeking reassurance, and checking things. Many adults with OCD are aware that their compulsions do not make sense, but they perform them anyway to relieve the distress caused by obsessions. Compulsions occur so often, typically taking up at least one hour per day, that they impair one's quality of life.</p>

                <p> <strong> Here are questions that might help you decide if you are experiencing symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder: </strong> </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Do you have a fear of being contaminated by touching objects others have touched?</li>
                    <li>Do you have doubts that you've locked the door or turned off the stove?</li>
                    <li>Do you feel intense stress when objects aren't orderly or facing a certain way?</li>
                    <li>Do you arranging your canned goods to face the same way?</li>
                    <li>Do you hand-wash until your skin becomes raw?</li>
                </ul>

                <p>If you answered yes to several of these questions, you might have obsessive-compulsive disorder and should seek a full diagnostic evaluation.</p>

            <h1>Treatment</h1>

            <div class="section-content">

                <p>Fortunately, treatment is available and can often result in significant improvements in OCD symptoms.</p>
                
                <p>Studies have shown that Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and psychotropic medications are the first-line treatments for OCD. Other forms of psychotherapy, such as psychodynamics and psychoanalysis, may help in managing some aspects of the disorder.</p>
            
                <p>The following information is provided as a guideline and should not be used in substitution for a consultation with a mental health specialist. People with OCD may have a variety of additional problems and may experience varying responses to treatments, so a comprehensive assessment by a psychiatrist and an individualized treatment plan (ideally in conjunction with a psychotherapist) are highly recommended.</p>
